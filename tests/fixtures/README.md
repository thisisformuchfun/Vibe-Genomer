# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample genomic data files for testing.

## Files

- `sample.vcf` - Small VCF file with a few variants
- `sample.bam` - Minimal BAM file for testing
- `sample.fastq` - Small FASTQ file with a few reads
- `reference.fa` - Tiny reference sequence

## Usage

These files are intentionally small to keep the test suite fast.
They contain valid genomic data but are not meant for production use.
